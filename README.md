## My process
First build the HTML structure:
  a container for the whole blog card
  b container for each segment ( there is 5 segements)
  c link the img , write the heading and paragraph and icon.
  d start the styling using css.
  e finally review, make sure that the design as close to preview as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

A good learning experience,
in this challenge i worked with how to use multipel fonts and styles.
```css
  @font-face {
    font-family: semiBold;
    src: url('./assets/fonts/static/Figtree-SemiBold.ttf');
}
```
adding dynamic UI
```css
  .btn:hover{
    background:#a4892f ;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```
i also was able to control the size of the contianer using max and min width instead of media queries.

overall it was a good challenge

 

### Continued development

I hope to continue working on styling and dynamic UI.
